# rayframe
 Basic OO abstraction layer/template for node-raylib projects.

# Pre-reqs
- Node.js >= 10.0
- Git (installation)

node-raylib, TypeScript and ts-node are automatically included.

# Example
Check out a fully working demo based off of Rayframe [here](https://github.com/TeleKiwi/rayframe-demo). 
WARNING: Generated off of v1.4.1; may be very different to the Rayframe you are currently looking at!

# Get started

## Auto
Click the 'Use this template' button to duplicate this repo and get started with it.

Alternatively, you can grab rayframe directly from npm.
    npm install rayframe
If you're gonna do this, however, make sure to drag out rayframe from
node_modules!!!

## Manual
    git clone https://github.com/TeleKiwi/rayframe
    cd (where you installed rayframe)

## RUNNING
As of rayframe v1.1, TS is now auto-configured. There's package.json scripts to automate the transpilation and running process.
